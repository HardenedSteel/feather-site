This is an emergency release to fix "Internal Error: Unrealistic number of outputs in output distribution" that prevented any transactions from being constructed.

The number of outputs on the blockchain exceeds a safety limit present in version 2.6.5 and below that was meant to mitigate output distribution poisoning. This caused a sanity check to fail during transaction construction.

Update your wallet to version 2.6.6 or later to resolve this issue.

- send: in automatic fee mode, an option to use the 'High' fee-tier is presented if there is a backlog of 3 or more blocks at the 'Normal' fee-tier
- send: removed unnecessary RPC calls, which slightly speeds up construction on slow networks

- trezor: disabled bridge transport, improved error messages
- trezor: selecting an address in the Receive tab no longer requires device communication
- windows: more mitigations against false-positive AV detections
- fixed a potential crash on exit

#### Maintenance
