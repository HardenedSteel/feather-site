This is an emergency release to fix "Internal Error: Unrealistic number of outputs in output distribution" that prevented any transactions from being constructed.

The number of outputs on the blockchain exceeds a safety limit that was meant to mitigate output distribution poisoining. This caused a sanity check to fail during transaction construction. A large number of outputs were added last month in a [spam attack](https://github.com/Rucknium/misc-research/blob/main/Monero-Black-Marble-Flood/pdf/monero-black-marble-flood.pdf).

Update your wallet to version 2.6.6 or later to resolve the issue.

A post-mortem and a full list of changes will follow shortly.
