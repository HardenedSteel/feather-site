Notes:

Windows users that installed Feather using the installer should update manually. Download the 2.1.0 installer from featherwallet.org/download and follow the installation procedure like normal.

MacOS builds are now cross-compiled and reproducible. Work on migrating the build system to Guix + `depends` was expedited due to a persistent issue with native non-static builds. This is a significant change and may inadvertently cause compatibility issues on some versions of macOS. If you were previously able to run Feather but are not able to run 2.1.0, please [report](https://docs.featherwallet.org/guides/report-an-issue) it. 

All release binaries except macOS were [built](https://github.com/feather-wallet/feather/blob/master/BUILDING.md) using Docker. We will gradually phase out Docker builds in favor of [bootstrappable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2iShmUTEl8) Guix builds in future releases after additional testing.

Please note that all Feather versions 1.0.1 and lower will stop working after the August 13 hardfork. Make sure to update your wallet to 2.0.0 or later before contacting support.
