#### Build system changes

This release introduces major changes to Feather's build system. While this doesn't affect any user-facing functionality, it does enable faster, more secure releases.

Feather Wallet releases are now [bootstrappable](http://bootstrappable.org/). This means that we are able to build our entire toolchain and dependencies from their source code. By leveraging [Guix](https://guix.gnu.org/), a reproducible build environment can be [set-up](https://github.com/feather-wallet/feather/tree/master/contrib/guix) on any Linux host in a matter of minutes. The [depends](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/depends) build system makes it possible to build for all target platforms from a single machine through cross-compilation. This greatly reduces release engineering overhead and allows for much faster release cycles, which is especially useful for important bug fixes. It also reduces the risk of supply chain attacks, as all dependencies are pinned and upgrades can be thoroughly reviewed. All builds are bit-for-bit reproducible, and all third-party source code can be accessed indefinitely through [fallback mechanisms](https://featherwallet.org/files/sources/), ensuring that Feather releases remain reproducible.

#### New supported platforms

Starting with this release Feather supports **Raspberry Pi** and **Linux ARM64**. Support for RISC-V is planned.
Linux ARM64 builds aren't currently listed on the downloads page, but can be found here: https://featherwallet.org/files/releases/

#### Qt upgrade

Qt was upgraded from 5.15 to 6.4. You may notice some small visual differences compared to the previous version. We're aware of some text cutoff happening in table headers in dark mode, this will be fixed soon.

#### macOS release

macOS builds now ship as a .dmg file. The [installation instructions](https://docs.featherwallet.org/guides/macos) were updated to reflect this.

#### Webcam QR scanner

The webcam QR scanner now works on standalone Linux binaries. On Linux, the scanner no longer depends on GStreamer, but uses V4L2 directly. Considerable changes were made to Qt's multimedia backend between 5.15 and 6.4, which may have fixed some bugs and introduced others.

Please let us know if you experience any issues with the scanner on this release.

#### Source tarballs

Signed source tarballs can now be downloaded from the downloads page. If you're looking to package Feather for your distribution, please hop on `#feather:monero.social` for guidance.

#### Windows installer

The installer for Windows was ported from Inno Setup to NSIS. You can run the new installer to upgrade your current Feather installation without uninstalling the old version first.

#### Hardware wallets on Windows 11

This release fixes an issue that could cause Feather to be unable to access hardware wallets on Windows 11.
